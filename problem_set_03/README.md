# SI 506: Problem Set 03

## This week's Problem Set

This Problem Set focuses on working with dictionaries, tuples, strings and lists.

## Background

With just one year to go to the Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022, the excitement is growing among winter sports athletes and fans from around the world.

From 4â€“20 February 2022, the best winter athletes will gather in the Chinese capital as well as Zhangjiakou to compete for 109 gold medals.

## 1.0 Problem 01 (10 points)

1. Shijingshan District, a district in urban area of Beijing will feature the snowboarding `'Big Air'` event. Zhangjiakou city, Hebei province will feature all other snowboarding events: `'Cross'`, `'Halfpipe'`, `'Parallel slalom'`, `'Slopestyle'`. Create two tuples `shijingshan` and `zhangjiakou`, which contain the snowboarding events.

2. **Concatenate** tuples `shijingshan` and `zhangjiakou` together to form a new tuple `snowboarding_events`

The expected value of `snowboarding_events` is

```python
('Big Air', 'Cross', 'Halfpipe', 'Parallel slalom', 'Slopestyle')
```

## 2.0 Problem 02 (10 points)

1. The list `sports` contains 7 sport of the Winter. Use **list slicing** and **list concatenation** to generate a new list `sports_new` where strings are sorted in **alphabetical order**.

The expected value of `sports_new` is

```python
['Biathlon', 'Bobsledding', 'Curling', 'Ice hockey', 'Luge', 'Skating', 'Skiing']
```

:exclamation: In order to pass the autograder, please don't **hard-code** the value for `sports_new` or use the method `list.sort()`

:bulb: There are multiple ways of solving problem 01. One possible way is:

   1. slice `["Biathlon", "Bobsledding"]`
   2. reverse slice `["Luge", "Ice hockey", "Curling"]`
   3. slice `["Skating"]` and slice `["Skiing"]`
   4. concatenate 1,2,3 together to form `sports_new`

## 3.0 Problem 03 (20 points)

Each sport might have multiple disciplines and each discipline can have multiple events.

1. `skating_disciplines` contains three disciplines of skating separated by pipe `'|'`. Convert `skating_disciplines` to lower case, split it on the pipe and assign the value to the variable named `skating_disciplines_list`

2. `events_count` contains the event count for three skating disciplines respectively. Generate three dictionaries with names `figure_skating`, `short_track_speed_skating`, `speed_skating`. Each dictionary contains two key-value pairs following the format:

```
{
   "name": <discipline name>,
   "count": <event count>
}
```

:bulb: Use list indexing to access the skating discipline name from `skating_disciplines_list` and events count from `events_count`

## 4.0 Problem 04 (20 points)

1. Use `str.replace()`, `str.title()` to change the `name` of `figure_skating` from `'figure skating'` to `'Figure_Skating'`

2. Update the `count` of `short_track_speed_skating` from `9` to `12`

3. Remove the key:value pair associated with the key `'count'` from `speed_skating`

## 5.0 Problem 05 (20 points)

1. Use **dictionary literal** to create an empty dictionary named `sports_dict`

2. Add a new key-value pair to `sports_dict`, where key is `'Skating'` and value is an empty list

3. Append three dictionaries `figure_skating`, `short_track_speed_skating`, `speed_skating` to the list under the key `'Skating'` in `sports_dict`

4. Use `list.pop()` to remove the last element from the list

## 6.0 Problem 06 (20 points)

1. Update `sports_dict` with the given dictionary `curling`
2. Calculate the sum of the number of words used in the values under the key `name`. Assign the sum to the variable `word_count`

:exclamation: In order to pass the autograder, please don't **hard-code** the value for `word_count`

:bulb: There are multiple ways of solving Problem 05. One possible way is to access each value using correct key and index, then use `str.split()`, `len()`
